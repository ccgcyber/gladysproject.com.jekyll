Hey everyone!

I wanted to announce you the biggest news on Gladys since the beginning of the project! 

🚀🚀 I'M GOING PART-TIME ON GLADYS !! 🚀🚀

I wrote a big article on Patreon about why I'm doing this, you can find the article here => [https://www.patreon.com/gladysproject/overview](https://www.patreon.com/gladysproject/overview).

A big thanks to the whole Gladys community who's supporting me everyday in this crazy adventure 🙏

See you soon on Gladys!
