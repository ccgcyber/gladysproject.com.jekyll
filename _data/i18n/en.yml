    controlHouse:
      title: Sensors
      text: "It's 8.10 AM, Gladys detects thanks to a motion sensor that you are getting out of bed. She immediately starts the wake-up scenario : she tells the coffee machine to prepare the coffee, and opens the blinds."
    wakeUp:
      title: Wake Up
      text:  It's 8 AM. Gladys wakes you up automatically because she knows that you need to be at work at 9 AM, and that according to the traffic, you'll need 30min to go to work with your car. She knows that you like 30 min to get ready. She wakes you up with a soft progressive warm light thanks to your Philips Hue, and puts a nice music in your room.
    scenario:
      title: Smart Scenarios
      text: At 8.30 AM, you leave the house. Gladys detects thanks to your smartphone that you are not at home anymore, and shuts down everything inside.
    sleep:
      title: Waiting for you
      text: "At 6.30 PM, you are getting back home : Everything is ready when you arrive. You are going to sleep, so you simply put your phone on your nightstand where a NFC tag is sticked. It immediately sends a request to Gladys to tell here you are going to sleep. She starts the \"Going to sleep\" scenario, and turns off all lights."
