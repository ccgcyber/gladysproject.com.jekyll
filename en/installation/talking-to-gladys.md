## Talking to Gladys

To speak with Gladys, you can either use [gladys-voice](https://github.com/GladysProject/gladys-voice) to talk with her, or you can speak by message directly on Gladys dashboard, or with the [Telegram app](https://developer.gladysproject.com/en/modules/telegram).

### How it works

Gladys is using machine learning to recognize sentences. We trained a model with sentences given by the community, so the trained model is able to classify future questions asked by the user.

The database is totally open-source, and not that big for the moment, but we strongly encourage pull-requests to add possibilities to Gladys!
