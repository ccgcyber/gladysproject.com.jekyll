# Configure your devices in Gladys

You probably want to control everything in your house with Gladys: Connected lights, coffee machine, music...

In Gladys, everything is "abstract". Gladys core is like a brain, it thinks about turning the light on, but it doesn't know how the light is working. To control a light, Gladys needs a module that will work as a driver. When you ask Gladys "Turn on the lights in the kitchen", she will understand that all devices of type "lights" in room "kitchen" need to be turned on, but will ask to each module of each light to do the job of physically contacting the light.

To control devices, you need to install the right module for the each technology of device you want to control => [https://developer.gladysproject.com/en/modules](https://developer.gladysproject.com/en/modules) 🙂
